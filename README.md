# VMworld Demo App

This is the repository used for the Demo App in the VMworld 2021 talk: Cloud-Native Fundamentals: Containers and Kubernetes 101 for the VI Admin [MCL1257]

The talk consists of two parts:

* Building the Container
* Running the container in a Kubernetes environment

## The App

This is a very simple static HTML side showing the VMworld content and some additional links with more information around the topics. If you would like to learn more about containers follow these links:

## Deployment

We're using a simple deployment file to start the application in our Kubernetes cluster. For more advanced techniques like helm or carvel please have a look at the following content:
